<h2>The Community & Culture</h2>
<p>Santa Barbara, CA is a suburban town right on the coast of California. There are gnereations upon generations that have been born and riased in this town and never leave. Family is a staple in this town. Personally, my entire family is from Santa Barbara. I have generation of family born and raised here. Growing up I went to the same preschool, elementary, high school as my grandparents, my father, my aunts, uncles and all my cousins. There are many families like mine with a long line of relatives that grow up tight knit like mine does. In this town, family means everything.</p>
