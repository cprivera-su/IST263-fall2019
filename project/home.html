    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <h4>Personal Profile:</h4>
        <img class="image" src="images/profile.png">
    <p>Hello, my name is Celine Rivera. Up until college, I have lived my entire life on the West Coast. I was born and raised in Central California, in a town called Santa Barbara. However, I decided to venture off and experience a different life for my college years. For the past three years I have been adjusting myself to the East Coast lifestyle and have been loving my new normal. But, that doesn't mean I don't get homesick from time to time. I have created this site to give you, the reader, a look at my life at home. Enjoy!</p>

    <h2>My Mission</h2>
    <h3>Image Below: The Santa Barbara Sunken Gardens</h3>
    <img class="image" src="images/gardens.jpg">
    <p>No trip to the American Riviera is complete without visiting the Sunken Gardens. The gardens is located at the Santa Barbara Courthouse, which is also recognized as one of the country’s most beautiful buildings. When visiting the Gardens, you might as well look around the courthouse. Built in 1929, this building has been labeled as one of the “grandest Spanish Colonial Revival structure ever built!" Quick fun fact: The population of Santa Barbara is approximately 100,000! There is truly no place like Santa Barbara. Have fun exploring the site and maybe you'll find yourself visiting my town soon!</p>
