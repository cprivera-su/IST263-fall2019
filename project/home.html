          Hello, my name is Celine Rivera. Up until college, I have lived my entire life on the West Coast. I was born and raised in Central California, in a town called Santa Barbara. However, I decided to venture off and experience a different life for my college years. For the past three years, I have been adjusting myself to the East Coast lifestyle and have been loving my new normal. But, that doesn't mean I don't get homesick from time to time. I have created this site to give you, the reader, a look at my life at home. Enjoy!</p>

          <p class="start">  
          <br>
          For eighteen years, I resided in a small, beach town called Santa Barbara, located in the beautiful state of California. When it came time for me to venture off for college, I knew that I wanted to get out of my comfort zone and experience life in a different part of the country. Never did I think I would end up in the great state of New York, but I am grateful that I did. Although I only go home twice a year, I now appreciate my hometown for its beauty, community, and food!</p>

              No trip to the American Riviera is complete without visiting the Sunken Gardens. The gardens are located at the Santa Barbara Courthouse, which is recognized as one of the state's most beautiful buildings. When visiting the Gardens, you might as well look around the courthouse. Built in 1929, this building is labeled as one of the "grandest Spanish Colonial Revival structure ever built!" Quick fun fact: The population of Santa Barbara is approximately 100,000! There is truly no place like Santa Barbara.
