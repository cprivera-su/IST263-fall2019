    <p>The Culture and Community in Santa Barbara
        When I think of Santa Barbara, I think of family. Santa Barbara is where all my family resides. This town is comprised of large families, most who have lived there for many generations. The Mexican culture is displayed throughout the city, primarily through its people and historic architecture.</p>
