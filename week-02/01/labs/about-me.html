<p>Hello! My name is Celine Rivera. I am currently a Junior at Syracuse University. I am majoring in the iSchool, studying Information Management and Technology. Origionally I am from Santa Barbara, CA. I plan on graduating from the iSchool in Winter 2020. In my spare time I enjoy reading, going to the movies and spending time with close friends and family.  </p>
<p>On campus, I am an active member of TEDxSyracuseUniversity and Nexis, both student run organizations associated with the iSchool. This past summer I worked as an IT intern in New York City for a large pharmaceutical advertising agency. I enjoyed my internship exceedingly and hope to return to the company, following graduation. I hope to one day reside in California with my family, but for now I am appreciating my time on the East Coast and enjoying my college experience.</p>
